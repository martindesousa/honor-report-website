On this project, I (Martin) worked mostly on the following tasks:
* Setting up and Maintaining Heroku and its accompanying PostgreSQL database
* Connectivity between the frontend and backend through management of configuration such as the Procfile, manage.py, and requirements.txt
* Ensuring consistency in the CI/CD pipeline
* Minor user-experience related web-facing features, such as transforming and modifying logins and buttons, as well as the underlying scripting behind them
* Minor details on django models, testing, routing, and view logic.
